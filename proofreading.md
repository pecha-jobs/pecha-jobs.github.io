# Proofreading

Welcome to our Tibetan language proofreading services!

As a publisher, you know the importance of presenting clean, error-free texts to your readers. That's where we come in. Our team of experienced proofreaders is here to ensure that your Tibetan language texts are free of mistakes and ready for publication.

## Our semi-automated proofreading service

Our proofreading process is thorough and efficient. First, two or more members of our team individually proofread your text or texts. We then feed the proofread versions into an OpenPecha textual comparison tool to highlight the differences. Our proofreading team lead then checks the differences between the versions and chooses the correct one, resulting in an error-free version of your text.

With our help, you can confidently publish Tibetan language texts that are polished and professional.
