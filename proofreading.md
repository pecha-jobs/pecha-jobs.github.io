# Proofreading services

Our proofreading services involve the following process:

1. Two or more members of our team individually proofread your text or texts.
2. We feed the proofread versions into an OpenPecha textual comparison tool to highlight the differences.
3. Our proofreading team lead then checks the differences between the versions and chooses the correct one

The result is in a an error-free version of your text.
