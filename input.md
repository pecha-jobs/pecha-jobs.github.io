# Input

Our team can input from physical books or image files.

The process:

1. If the source is a physical book, scan the book.
2. Using OpenPecha's OCR tech stack, OCR the PDF or image files with a few different OCR models.
3. Compare the results syllable by syllable. For each difference, the software chooses the most common result among the versions.
4. Finally, our team proofreads the e-text against the original book or images. 

The result is a faithful input of your texts.
