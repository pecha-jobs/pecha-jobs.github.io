OpenPecha is a free open repository of e-texts and annotations made publicly available on GitHub and through a set of APIs. The projectâ€™s primary aim is to facilitate the collection, proofreading, and enrichment of e-texts by leveraging language technology and collaboration.

Our dataset is gradually increasing in quantity and quality through direct contributions from core members and from apps that use our APIs.

OpenPecha is structured as three APIs:

- The **Librarian API** functions as a librarian would. Ask where you can get a book or a list of books on a given topic, and you'll get actual book files or information about books. 

- The **Scholar API** functions as a scholar would. If you want information about a subject, you'll get a detailed answer in the form of citations from the reference literature. 

- The **Professional API** functions as an experienced working professional would. Ask it a question and you'll get a simple, to-the-point answer that is relevant to your situation.
