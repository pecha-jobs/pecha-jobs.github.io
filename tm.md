# Translation linking

Our translation linking or translation alignment process is semi-automated. We use alignment software that is currently 65-70 percent accurate and our alignment team adjust the results.

We also feed the results of alignment projects back into the translation linking software to train software and improve its quality in the future. This will make it more cost-effective going forward.
