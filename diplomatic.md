# Diplomatic e-text creation

A diplomatic e-text is a digital edition exactly reproducing an original version. Diplomatic etexts are designed to reproduce all the orthographic information found in  single printed version of a work (its spellings, punctuation, capitalization, line divisions, marginalia, and rubrication). Diplomatic etexts facilitate scholarly study of a text.

We leverage both OpenPecha's technology and our network of Tibetan native specialists to prepare diplomatic etexts.
