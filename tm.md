# Translation linking

Our translation linking or translation alignment process is semi-automated. We start with using alignment software that is currently 65-70 percent accurate. From there, our our alignment team adjusts the results.

We also feed the results of alignment projects back into the translation linking software to train the software and improve its quality in the future. This will make it more cost-effective going forward.
