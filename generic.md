# Generic e-text creation

For many Tibetan books, there exist many editions. In the past, there were various woodblock versions and with modern printing, many monasteries and organizations have inputed these text into computers and printend them for their communities. Along the way, each woodblock cutters and data enterers have both fixed mistakes in otehr editions, and made some of their own. As a result, it's difficult to assess which version is best. 

Our solution is what we call a **generic text**, which is an automatically proofread version of a text. 

To create a generic text, we use an tool created by OpenPecha that compares multiple digital editions of the same work on a character-character basis. It calculates the most probable version of each syllable and strings them together to form a new, cleaner version of the text. The process removes spelling mistakes and deletes noise such as page headers, footnotes and running titles, allowing us to create a high-quality e-text from several imperfect sources.

To preserve the tradition from which the text you give us originated from, we also add an annotation layer to the newly created generic text. This layer contains the original file that you give us and points out the differences between the generic version and the original version so that nothing is lost, only gained.
